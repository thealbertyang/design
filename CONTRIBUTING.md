# Contributing to Once UI

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute! Once UI is an indie project built by creators who care deeply about great interfaces, systems thinking, and developer experience. Every bug report, feature suggestion, or pull request helps.

## Monorepo structure

This repo uses a monorepo layout with PNPM workspaces:

`/packages/core` → The Once UI package [@once-ui-system/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@once-ui-system/core)
`/apps/dev` → Local sandbox app for testing components (not for production)

## Running the dev environment

The dev app is symlinked to the core package for rapid iteration.

```bash
pnpm install
cd apps/dev
pnpm dev
```

This will boot up a local app using the latest version of the package, ideal for testing and development.
